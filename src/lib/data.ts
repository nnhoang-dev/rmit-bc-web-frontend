In order to have that outstanding development, in addition to the improvements of technology, it also requires support from two important functions, Logistics and Marketing.
		In fact, Logistics is considered the ""backbone"" for an E-Commerce company to operate with high efficiency. Besides, the characteristic of E-Commerce is that sellers and buyers do not conduct direct transactions. Therefore, an effective logistics system is the decisive factor to gain trust from customers. On the other hand, Marketing is considered the ""face"" of E-Commerce. In this digital age, sellers have difficulty understanding the buyers needs due to the lack of direct interaction with them. To solve this problem, businesses have integrated Marketing into E-Commerce to easily reach customers, thereby creating a new business trend in this field.
